# Problem :
Provide actionable recommendations to a ride sharing company to help them reduce their attrition rates by predicting whether a driver will be leaving the company or not based on their attributes like demographics, Tenure information, performance of the driver.


# Insights : 
- 68% of drivers leave the company
- Last Working data is negatively correlated with Quarterly Rating (-0.34), Total Business value (-0.29) and Grade (-0.22)
- LastWorkingDate has strong correlation with quarterly_rating_increased (-0.41) and TBV_std (-0.32)
- Test Data ROC AUC Score : 
    - Random Forest Classifier : 0.74
    - XGBoost Classifier : 0.77
- Most important features:
    - If the quarterly rating increases or not
    - Total Business value generated by driver
    - Quarterly Rating of driver
    

# Recommendations : 
- The ride sharing company needs to reach out to drivers who have generated low Business value in the last quarter and understand what they are doing wrong, solve their tech issues (if any) and suggest some strategies which have worked for other drivers and help them  boost their revenue generation in the upcoming quarter. 
- Increasing Quarterly Rating has a huge impact on drivers decision to stay in the company. So the ride sharing company should update their policy to be more liberal in increasing rating of drivers and try to decouple it from the total business value generated by them.
